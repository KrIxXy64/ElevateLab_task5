# ElevateLab_task5
This task involved capturing and analyzing live network traffic using Wireshark. The active network interface was selected and packet capture was started, after which normal internet activity was generated by visiting websites and using the ping command to produce DNS, ICMP, TCP, and other traffic. After capturing for around one minute, the capture was stopped and saved as a .pcap file. Filters such as dns, tcp, and icmp were applied to view specific protocol packets, and screenshots were taken to show the filtered results. The .pcap file and screenshots included in this repository demonstrate the identification of multiple protocols and basic packet analysis using Wireshark.
